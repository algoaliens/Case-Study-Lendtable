# Lendtable 
### A Revolutionary Fintech Company

---


#### Overview and Origin

The idea for this company stemed off the efforts to fight financial inequality in USA through giving low income individuals wealth building cash advances. Founders, Mitchell Jones, a Yale graduate and formerDropBox emplyee alongside Sheridan Claybourne, Northwestern's youngest ever student at 15 also a former DropBox employee, founded this company in January of 2020.

With 26 founders, Lendtable was able to secure 18 million dollars during their Series A round closing in November of 2021.


### Business Activities and Landscape
Lendtable aims to provide cash advancements for those who cannot afford to set money aside from their paycheck for their retirement accounts so that their employer can contribute the maximum amount without compromising the client's monthly budget. If you are someone who cannot afford to set aside 1k a month, for example, from your paycheck to maximize your employer's matching contribution they will give you that 1k for you to contribute for a low monthly fee of $10 plus a profit share once those funds are withdrawn. With Lendtable you can save money for retirement *and* keep your full paycheck for living expenses.

As we stand today, Lendtable is the only Fintech company of it's kind. No other start-up is offering this type of loan with a $10 monthly subscription that could potentially turn into hundreds of months with the a 20 year old individual planning for retirement. With no other competitors offering the same services, Lendtable has a blue ocean of opportunity. 


Their customer service solution is powered by Intercom, a human-AI duo that enables and facilicates their communication feature. However the rest of this tightly-knit start-up has managed to keep their methods and maddness off the internet for now.  


## Results
So far, Lendtable has been maximizing hundreds of thousands of dollars from employer contributions for employees who would have otherwise not been able to save for retirement. Before Lendtable, clients were able to save 0% for retirement and that change in that metric is how these two founders measure success; alongside the success of those who they service.

## Recommendations

Aside from profiting off of someone's needs, a profit share and a monthly fee this company offers their services to those living paycheck to paycheck to give them a solution to their retirement saving needs. Everyone is going to retire at some point, might as well use the resources that are already available to you to plan for it. Lendtable does not currently advertise itself as a financial advising company however I think it would be beneficial to bring a financial advising team on board to also profit on this part of their process. Talking people into saving from a professional might be a good way for someone to strongly consider Lendtable's services.
